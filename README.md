## Design

### Colour Scheme:
The colour palette was created by [Coolors](https://coolors.co) with the thought to provide as much contrast as possible, without feeling overwhelming. Most of the colour is primarily provided as a simple and calm across the site. However backgrounds were generated in two main colors ( calm gray, and white ) also the text has two main colors (black, sky calm blue) but some text has a one of gray degree color such as a paragraph in landing section and white color for the text inside missions page, also using black shadows with background white or even calm gray such as with photos section in gallery page. The combination of the background color and shadow color, does not overwhelm the user but give simple and stylish feeling. Also with a feature in navigation bar elements, when the cursor hover on each element, that will change the element color from black to calm blue with a very beatiful animation line will show above and below it to bring the users immediate attention to the fact that there is something there to be clicked.

### Typography:
Open Sans was selected for the all Website pages as this font is a very famous, simple, readable and clear, also with manipulating between letters spacing and make it bold in some places make it looking great.

### Imagery:
All the imagery on the site, was sources from free gaming stock photo platforms. some photos in gallery section were readjust the brightness, exposure, contrast and shadows to make it more clear and modern to display it.

## Credits

### Content
- My knowledge of implementation is more advanced because of my of my bachelor degree in IT, the initial set up & style was set close to my worked with previous projects in my university which is also similar to the 'Love Running' walk-through project. From there, I took inspiration for the design of the navigation bar, landing section,,,, along with the display of the social links in the footer element.

- The styling of the form element in 'Love Running' was used beside my previouse experince as a starting point for my form, but I never follow the steps of float property to arrange the element places on webpage becuase float is complex and not flexy. So I used to work with flexbox and grid as more easy to control the elements on webpage.

- I follow my quote since my university study, that said when you start to build html page make sure to build a good structure with semantic elements and Div containers that will make you understand it very well and that will make for you more easy to initiate the correct properties to right targeted element.

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp) website was used to remember some properites and the correct values range that I want to set in each property, so for me it's the main website after I finished from CSS and HTML curriculum on code-institute website as it helped me in many situations.

- Most of issues that faced were in Media rules so I follow the way that feel me comfort and well code structured so I set for every element and sometimes in each section it's own media rules then test it and show how it's behaviours with elements page after that I moved to another element or section.

- I used to read previouse posts on Slack Code-Institute Channels( PP1 / peer code review / my class channel too) these channels are showed old / previous issues that people faced with their code and some solutions provided from alumnis. these info and posts increase my knowledge because I love to read and search in Slack Channels even if i don't have issues with my website or code, because that will make me know more what others facing in their code, also sometimes I replied to them with my solution and see if I'm right or somebody will correct mine or provide another solution.

- I want to add small note that I played some online games that made me remember all the details/values inside flex and Grid properties with examples. These games are: [Mastery Games](https://mastery.games/post/flexboxzombies2/), [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/), [Flex Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and all very recommended to master these properties.
